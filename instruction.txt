TD3 modified with consistency critic
Sample take many steps, but when computing loss, only one step

consistency_actor
1. forward: -> sample in consistency_actor -> forward in consistency -> bunch of predict_consistency 
2. loss : -> predict_consistency for bc_loss
          -> sample in consistency_actor -> forward in consistency -> bunch of predict_consistency 

Issue: didn't involve with theta'
Combine it with Q-socre matching
Also random step
